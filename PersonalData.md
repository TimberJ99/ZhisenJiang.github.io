# Biography

I am a Ph.D. student at the Automatic Control Laboratory (IfA) at ETH Zürich and works with [Dr. Saverio Bolognani]([Saverio Bolognani](https://www.bsaver.io/)) and [Prof. Florian Dörfler](https://dorfler.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich.

I received the B.Eng. degree (with honors) in Electrical Engineering from North China Electric Power University and M.S. degree (with honors) in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, China, in 2022 and 2025, respectively. During my master’s studies, he was supervised by [Prof. Ye Guo](guo-ye.net).

I am interested in applying game theory and control theory to power systems. In my previous work, I designed peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms and developed allocation methods for Dynamic Operating Envelopes in distribution networks. Currently, I am working on **co-designing incentives and automation strategies** for transmission and distribution network coordination. In my free time, I enjoys traveling and watching basketball games.
