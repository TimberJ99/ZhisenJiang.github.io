  This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for peer-to-peer-to-grid energy trading embedded with Dynamic Operating Envelopes (DOEs). The proposed approach utilizes DOEs to facilitate the grid-friendly P2P trading of prosumers. Moreover, the so-called DOE price is proposed to allow prosumers purchase more network injection limits.
