  I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://control.ee.ethz.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automatic Control Laboratory (IfA)</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH Z√ºrich</a>, working with <a href="https://dorfler.ethz.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Florian D√∂rfler</a> and <a href="https://www.bsaver.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Saverio Bolognani</a>. I received my B.Eng. degree (with honors) in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North China Electric Power University</a> and M.S. degree (with honors) in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tsinghua University</a>, China, in 2022 and 2025, respectively.</br></br> I am interested in applying game theory and control theory to <strong>power systems</strong>. In my previous work, I designed peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms and developed allocation methods for Dynamic Operating Envelopes in distribution networks. Currently, I am working on <strong>co-designing incentives and automation strategies</strong> for transmission and distribution network coordination. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and watching basketball games.
